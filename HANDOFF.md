# HANDOFF

Session-by-session engineering log. Read this before starting work; update it
at the end of every session. Convention borrowed from NFSU2-3DS.

## Session 1 (2026-09-18) -- Project scaffolding, RE survey

**Goal:** turn the empty `NFSHP2-3DS` skeleton (just `PS2 Files/` + empty
`3DS Files/`) into a buildable devkitARM project, and figure out exactly what
we're working with on the PS2 side before committing to an RE approach.

### Key finding: this is NOT the NFSU2-3DS situation

NFSU2-3DS had no usable PS2 symbols and had to cross-reference an unrelated
GameCube debug ELF against a stripped PC binary to recover names ("Rosetta
Stone" approach, see that project's own HANDOFF.md).

`PS2 Files/NFSHP2.ELF` is different: it is **not stripped**.
- `.symtab`: 8,333 real `FUNC` symbols, GNU C++ v2 mangled (e.g.
  `AddRacingCar__FP...`), grouped by original object file via
  `NFSHP2.MAP` (`Main.obj`, `Camera.obj`, `EcstasyE.obj`, `Sound.obj`,
  `TrackRoute.obj`, `SEDWedge.obj`, `AnimatedDriver.obj`, ...).
- `.stab`/`.stabstr`: present but **small** (1,691 entries, ~20KB) -- turned
  out to be mostly `SLINE`/`SO`/`SOL` entries for VU0/VU1 microcode assembly
  source (`.vsm` files like `ecstasyu0Cap.vsm`), not general C++ type info.
  Dumped with `tools/stabs_dump.py`; output at `docs/stabs_dump.txt`.
- `.mdebug`: ~24.9MB (`0x17ce66c` bytes) -- this is almost certainly where
  the *real* struct/class layout and function-signature debug info actually
  lives. It's **MIPS ECOFF symbolic debug info** ("stabs-in-mdebug" is the
  SN Systems/SGI-toolchain convention for MIPS: local symbols use stab-style
  strings but are stored inside the ECOFF symbolic header's tables, not in a
  separate `.stab` section). The `readelf -p`/`strings` output showing full
  struct layouts (e.g. `DataEventSelectScreen:Tt1267=s16SelectedTreeType:...`)
  came from **this** section, not `.stab`.
- **This machine has no MIPS-aware binutils/gdb yet** (checked for
  `mips*-gdb`, `ee-gdb`, `ps2dev` -- none installed). Reading `.mdebug`
  properly needs one of: a `ps2dev`/`ee-gcc` toolchain install (its
  `ee-objdump`/`ee-gdb` understand ECOFF debug), a generic
  `mips64-elf-gdb`/`mips-linux-gnu-gdb` pointed at the ELF, or a
  hand-written ECOFF `HDRR`/`FDR`/`SYMR`/aux-table parser (bigger lift,
  only worth it if no working GDB can be found).
- **Next session should start here**: install/locate a MIPS-capable GDB or
  ps2dev toolchain, load `NFSHP2.ELF`, and confirm `ptype`/`info functions`
  surfaces the rich struct data before writing any custom ECOFF parser.

This engine is **bWare** (Black Box Games' in-house engine), confirmed via
`.MAP` library names (`bware/lib/libbware.a`, `bsound/lib/psx2/libbsndm.a`,
`bWare/devsys/psx2/ee/lib/libgraph.a`) and widespread `b`-prefixed symbol
names (`bVector`, `bQuaternion`, `bSlotPool`, `bDriverPS2`, etc). This is a
**different engine from NFSU2's**, so none of NFSU2-3DS's game-logic files
(`carsim.c`, `world.c`, `cardb.c`, `fng.c`, `texpack.c`, `model3d.c`, etc.)
are directly reusable -- only its **3DS-platform skeleton** is.

### What was done

1. `git init` + `.gitignore` (excludes `PS2 Files/` -- 300MB+ dump, not
   distributable -- and build artifacts).
2. Copied the reusable, engine-agnostic parts of NFSU2-3DS's 3DS-side
   project into `3DS Files/`:
   - `Makefile` (renamed `TARGET`/`APP_TITLE`/etc. for HP2)
   - `meta/app.rsf` (renamed `Title`/`ProductCode`/`UniqueId` -- kept every
     New3DS/memory/DSP ExHeader setting identical: `SystemMode: 96MB`,
     `SystemModeExt: 178MB`, `CpuSpeed: 804MHz`, `EnableL2Cache: true`,
     `CanAccessCore2: true`, the DSP `IORegisterMapping`, `StackSize: 0x40000`)
   - `source/heapcfg.c/.h` (Old/New3DS heap-split logic, verbatim except
     `NFSU2_HEAPCFG_H` -> `NFSHP2_HEAPCFG_H`, `NfsuHeapInfo` -> `NfsHeapInfo`)
   - `source/vp6/` (entire FFmpeg-derived VP6 decoder + EA SCHl demuxer +
     GPU-upload display layer, verbatim)
   - `source/jdlz.c/.h` (EA Blackbox JDLZ decompressor, verbatim -- **not
     yet confirmed HP2 uses JDLZ**; check `.symtab`/`.MAP` for
     `jdlz`/`JDLZ`-named symbols before relying on it in Phase 1)
   - `tools/3ds-bin/{makerom,bannertool}.exe`, `tools/bin/dspenc.exe` +
     `vgmstream/`, `tools/src/dspenc.c`, `tools/build_cia.ps1` (renamed
     paths/output name for HP2)
3. Wrote a placeholder `source/main.c` (New3DS-check + heap-diagnostic stub,
   no real boot flow yet -- that's Phase 2) just to prove the skeleton
   compiles and links.
4. **Verified the full build works end-to-end**: `NFSHP2-3DS.3dsx`,
   `.smdh`, and `.cia` all built successfully via
   `tools/build_cia.ps1`. Two things had to be fixed to get there:
   - `osGetSystemMode()` doesn't exist in libctru -- replaced with
     `APT_CheckNew3DS()` in the stub (that's the correct call anyway;
     it was a stub-writing mistake, not a skeleton problem).
   - **Environment gotcha, confirmed present on THIS machine and equally on
     NFSU2-3DS itself**: invoking `make` from a plain Git-Bash/PowerShell
     shell with `DEVKITARM`/`DEVKITPRO` exported manually silently produces
     an empty `$(INCLUDE)` inside the recursive `make -C build` step (all
     `-I...` flags vanish, so even `<3ds.h>` fails to resolve), even though
     the top-level `ifeq ($(strip $(DEVKITARM)),)` check passes. This is
     **not new** -- it reproduces identically against NFSU2-3DS's own
     Makefile in this environment. The only combination that works is
     `tools/build_cia.ps1`'s approach: `subst` a space-free drive letter,
     then run `make` through **devkitPro's own `msys2\usr\bin\bash.exe -l`**
     (its login profile sets `DEVKITARM`/`DEVKITPRO`/`PATH` correctly) --
     do not invoke devkitPro's `make.exe` from a different shell and expect
     manually-exported env vars to survive the recursive `$(MAKE) -C build`
     hop.
5. Wrote `tools/stabs_dump.py` (parses `.stab`/`.stabstr` into readable
   text, handling the per-compilation-unit string-offset-base reset that
   real STABS use). Confirmed working, but see the `.mdebug` finding above
   for why its output is small/limited right now.

### Next session

1. Get a MIPS-capable GDB or ps2dev toolchain installed; read `.mdebug` for
   real struct/class layouts (see finding above). This blocks meaningful
   Phase 1/2 RE work.
2. Set up the Ghidra project importing `NFSHP2.ELF` (MIPS R3000/R5900);
   check whether a community PS2 EE Ghidra processor extension is needed for
   MMI/VU-adjacent instructions, or if stock MIPS analysis is good enough
   for the mostly-scalar bWare game-logic code.
3. Start Phase 1: reverse-engineer `ZDIR.BIN`'s directory format (2,676
   bytes) as the index into `ZZDATA.BIN` (273MB). Look at what pulls in
   `bFile.obj`/`bFileE.obj`/`QueuedFile.obj` in the `.MAP` as the starting
   point for the loader code to decompile.
